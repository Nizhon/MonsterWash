# MonsterWash
MosterWash was developed over the course of nine weeks as a school group project in cooperation with PlayStation® First. In MonsterWash, your objective is to clean dirty monsters that their owners have turned in for a good ol’ scrubdown (think dog groomer but for monsters). But monsters like to be dirty and will fight you to stop themselves from getting clean. By evading and running around, you will try to survive the ferocious assault of attacks coming your way as you protect yourself with a water gun, soup grenades, and a squeaky toy.
